    <div class="container"></div>
    
    <p>Hi! I'm Nazir Shaikh, I'm half Indian and half Hungarian, I can't speak Hindi but I can speak a moderate amount of Hungarian. In my free time, I enjoy playing games and watching anime but I also enjoy spending time with my beloved family and playing with my siblings.</p>
    
    <p>I want to become a Software Developer Apprentice because I've always had an interest in technology, I finally properly realised I wanted a job in tech when I was doing ICT during both my GCSEs and A-Levels (as BTECs). During this time we were learning about the physical aspect of computers as well as the software aspect and started to code in Python; I wasn't particularly good at coding at that point in my life but I really enjoyed it and looked forward to my coding lessons compared to my theory lessons and knew this was something I wanted to get better at.  </p>

    <p>I want to do an apprenticeship in this as opposed to studying it at university because I really want to get into the working environment as soon as possible and have hands-on learning and work-life experience which I wouldn't be able to get in any other way. I think this would better help me in the future too as I would've already gained the fundamental soft skills of being a good software developer that a university graduate wouldn't have while also at the same time working to develop my technical skills.</p>

  <p>This was a project assigned to us by the Generation team during the 6-week coding Bootcamp we took, it took place on the 3rd week just as we were learning HTML and CSS. We were to work in teams of 5, each of us using BootStrap to aid us in making our own page on a country of our choice (mine was on Hungary), each page had to have a carousel of 3 images and 6 fact cards. Then when we were all done we sent the person who will 'host' the website our files so that they could compile them and link them together so that the NavBar would work, in this scenario I was the one who compiled and linked it all together. <br><br>
  This was a very valuable experience as it was the first time we had to work in a team to complete a serious task given to us and under a short time frame (about 4 hours including our lunch). It helped me get used to working under pressure and also at looking and understanding each others code as there were many times where one of us would be stuck on something and we'd share our screens to show our code so that others could give solutions to the problems.<br><br> Click <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NazirShaikh9093/countryWebsite">here</a> if you'd like to see or use the code.</p>

  <p>This was the final project that we had to do during the last week of the 6 week coding boot camp, it was to create a task planner which could add and delete tasks as well as saving them to the browser's local storage so that when you refresh the page or exit and come back to it, all the data will still be there. In the end as you can see in the image above, I managed to complete the task and it works, you can create your own task by inputting information into each field, which will then take the data through a validation check to make sure the fields aren't empty and to also check if the user has reached over a certain amount of characters as a minimum. You can then refresh the page and the cards will still be displayed, when you click on the delete button it will delete that card from the screen but it also deletes it from local storage and from the array containing all the different tasks in my JavaScript code. <br><br> Click <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NazirShaikh9093/WebsitePortfolio">here</a> if you'd like to see or use the code.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2><br>
<p>Like I briefly mentioned in my About Me section, I'm into anime and games. Growing up I was pretty much always surrounded by<br> games and always played with my younger brother, from the game boy's to the 3DS's and PSPs to the consoles we now have today, <br>im always interested in the new games and gaming devices getting released and it's just a huge part of me now. <br>The same goes with anime, although I only realised it was a thing and started watching some around the age of 15, it's still a big part of who I am <br>and below I'd like to share some that I grew up with and which shaped me as a person :) </p>
<br>

    <h3>Anime</h3>
    <div class="">
    <div class="card" style="width: 700px;">
      <h2>Naruto</h2>
      <img class="mx-auto" src="images/NarutoTeam7.png" class="card-img-top" alt="naruto anime image of team 7">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Naruto was the first anime that I started watching, I never knew about it or about anime in general but I played the games that they made based on it and around the age of 15 I was interested and began to watch it.<br><br>I can easily say now that it is one of my favourites of all time, watching the characters' journey from the beginning to the end was such an emotional journey and I feel nostalgic whenever I think about it. Despite it being an anime and not real, it has many important life lessons and, in my opinion, it is also one of the very few anime that has good soundtracks, I still listen to some of them to this day.</p>

        <h2>Death Note</h2>
        <img class="mx-auto" src="images/DeathNote.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="death note anime cover">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">This was recommended to me by a friend and I'm so glad that he told me to watch it, it's a classic that I'd recommend to anyone even if they're not that into anime (I heard the English voice acting on it is really good too but I'd still recommend it in Japanese with subtitles). 
            <br><br> This anime is of a detective genre and had my heart racing till the very end, this is definitely a gem in the sense it's really unique and the storyline is really well thought of, its not predictable like the anime nowadays and always has you wanting to watch the next episode to find out what will happen next.

      <img class="mx-auto" src="images/220px-Zone_of_the_Enders_Cover.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="zone of the enders game cover">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">This was the first game that I properly got into after growing up from being a baby and being able to finally understand and read words so I could actually complete a game. It will always be my most favourite game even compared to today's high graphic games.<br><br> The concepts of mechs and technology in the game really fascinated me along with the aspect of new energy sources and colonising other planets, it is one of the very few games that I went back to complete again and again, and even now I after experiencing today's types of games, I'd gladly go back and play it all over again.

        <h2>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2>
        <img class="mx-auto" src="images/SekiroWallpaper.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="zone of the enders game cover">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">In this game, you play as a samurai who has to defeat enemies and bosses in order to progress through the story. I find the combat system in this game really fun, you actually require skill and practice to get past something; you cannot just mash buttons and hope for the best like most combat games these days, and so you get a really good feeling of satisfaction when you finally get past something. <br><br> The art in this game is also really amazing as well as the voice acting and animation in both the English and Japanese playthroughs.
